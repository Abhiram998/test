You are an expert frontend engineer. Add a new offline-capable "Police Backup" feature to this React + TypeScript + Vite project. Create one new file and make minimal integration edits. Follow these exact requirements:

1) Create file: `src/components/PoliceBackup.tsx`
   - Implement a React functional component (TypeScript) named `PoliceBackup`.
   - Props:
     - `getRecords: () => VehicleRecord[]` where `VehicleRecord = { plate: string; zone: string; timeIn: string; timeOut?: string | null }`
     - `onRestore: (records: VehicleRecord[]) => void`
     - `appName?: string` (default: "nilakkal-police")
   - Features:
     - Save a timestamped snapshot to IndexedDB (DB name `${appName}-backup-db`, store "backups"). Each record saved should include `meta` (app, version, createdAt, recordCount) and `data` array.
     - List saved snapshots sorted newest first with `createdAt`, `recordCount`, and snapshot `id`.
     - Allow manual actions for each snapshot:
       - Export CSV (headers: plate, zone, timeIn, timeOut).
       - Export JSON (the saved payload).
       - Restore (call `onRestore(payload.data)` after a confirmation modal/popup).
       - Delete (manual user confirmation required).
     - Provide an Import JSON button to import a valid backup file and save it into IndexedDB as a snapshot (do not auto-apply).
     - No automatic deletions. All deletes must be user-initiated and confirmed.
     - Use standard browser `confirm()` for confirmations (OK).
   - UX:
     - Basic, accessible layout. Use Tailwind-style classes if Tailwind exists; otherwise simple inline styles. Avoid external UI libraries.
     - Show loading/working state as text.
     - Show friendly user messages on success/failure with `alert()` (simple).
   - Validation:
     - When importing or restoring, validate the payload contains an array at `payload.data` and that each item has `plate`, `zone`, and `timeIn`.
     - If invalid, show an error alert.
   - CSV generation: escape quotes, one header row, newline-separated rows.

2) Integration instructions (modify these files):
   - Add an example of how to use the component in `src/App.tsx` (or the main page):
     - Add `import PoliceBackup from "./components/PoliceBackup";`
     - Provide a `getRecords` implementation mapping your app's parking data into `VehicleRecord[]`.
     - Provide a simple `onRestore` that replaces the app's parking log state (use a placeholder `setParkingLog` or a comment indicating where to integrate).
     - Render `<PoliceBackup getRecords={getRecords} onRestore={onRestore} appName="nilakkal-police" />` inside the main UI (you may render it in a dev/admin area).
   - Do not change other project behavior or routing.

3) Testing & acceptance criteria:
   - After adding, running `npm run dev` must build without TypeScript errors.
   - Manually verify:
     - Click "Save Snapshot": a snapshot appears in the list.
     - Export CSV and JSON: files download and open correctly.
     - Import JSON: saved as snapshot and appears in list.
     - Restore: calls `onRestore` (for the example App.tsx usage, reflect restored data).
     - Delete: snapshot removed after confirmation.
   - IndexedDB store name must be `${appName}-backup-db` and object store `backups`.

4) Extra:
   - Keep the file self-contained and well-commented.
   - Keep code size moderate and readable; include types for main structures.
   - If Tailwind is not present, fall back to inline styles but keep classNames sensible.

Deliverables:
- New file `src/components/PoliceBackup.tsx`.
- Small diff/changes to `src/App.tsx` showing how to integrate and test (no other file changes).

If anything in the project structure conflicts, detect and explain succinctly what to modify and why. Provide the exact code for the new file and the exact snippet to add to `src/App.tsx`.
